# ImmoScout24Crawler

This was one of my first projects.
I know there is a lot of redundancy and the code and runtime could be improved for sure, but I think you can use the code as a good basis for your own project if you plan to write a crawler for https://www.immobilienscout24.de/.

It is important to pass the cookie "reese84", otherwise Immoscout will notice that you are a robot.
This must be updated from time to time.
I know you could counteract this by always changing the proxy, but at that time I didn't have the money for my own proxies :).

For the people who are asking themselves Immscout24 has no API?
Yes it does, but the price is 900â‚¬ per month for 10.000 API calls. ( I know this because I made a request for an API key at that time )
